      <h1> About Us</h1>
        <p> Over the past semester, the University of Colorado's Women's Ultimate A and B teams, Kali and Devi, have been discussing the cultural ties to Hinduism that our team names hold. We recognize that we have been participating in cultural appropriation by taking ownership in these names. In light of this, the current program members have decided to go forward with a name change for both teams. The new name for the A team is Quandary and for the B team Petra. This was not a decision that was made lightly, as we wanted to ensure that we were doing what was best for all involved. We arrived at this decision through a variety of steps including a conversation with current members of Kali and Devi about the origin of the names, consulting our beloved alumni on the their thoughts about changing the name, and an anonymous vote by current members on whether to change the names. We ultimately decided that although our team values throughout the years remain similar, our team names did not represent the respectful and inclusive ultimate community that we want to embody. As a program we have begun brainstorming new name ideas, and will begin the name selection process over the summer and start the fall of 2019 with new team names. Although we will be rebranding externally, we are excited to continue to embrace the same weird, dedicated and loving team culture that our program has embodied for the last 25+ years.</p>
